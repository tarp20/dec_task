Install Postgres Database:

1.Make sure that everything is working properly by entering postgres's command line interface with psql postgres. You should see you enter a shell that looks like postgres=#
2.Once in the interface, create a new database named movies with the command CREATE DATABASE movies; If creating the database succeeds, you will see the response CREATE DATABASE. 
3.For anyone to connect and access the database we created, they need a valid postgres username and password combination. This means that we need to create a dedicated user for django to interact with our new database. We create it with CREATE USER dec_task WITH PASSWORD 'dec_task';
4.Our new postgres user needs explicit permission to have read and write capabilities on our newly created database. We can do that with the command GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "movies" to dec_task; 
exit postgres
